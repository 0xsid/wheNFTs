# WheNFTs

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat project to ship an NFT collection onto Ethereum network. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. Currently under active developement.

Tested deployment onto Rinkeby: 0xDA5eB5935014335c72190BA53ad32b4B19910dcB

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
